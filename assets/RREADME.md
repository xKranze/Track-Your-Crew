# Track-Your-Crew
SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

IMPORTANT
In order to install inquirer, please use npm i inquirer@8.2.4.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

Refer to the Video Submission GuideLinks to an external site. on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.

User Story

AS A business owner

I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company

SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I start the application

THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role

WHEN I choose to view all departments

THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids

WHEN I choose to view all roles

THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role

WHEN I choose to view all employees

THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to

WHEN I choose to add a department

THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database

WHEN I choose to add a role

THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database

WHEN I choose to add an employee

THEN I am prompted to enter the employee’s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database

WHEN I choose to update an employee role

THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database

Getting Started
You’ll need to use the MySQL2 packageLinks to an external site. to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, the Inquirer packageLinks to an external site. to interact with the user via the command line, and the console.table packageLinks to an external site. to print MySQL rows to the console.

IMPORTANT
In order to install inquirer, please use npm i inquirer@8.2.4.

IMPORTANT
You will be committing a file that contains your database credentials. Make sure that your MySQL password is not used for any other personal accounts, because it will be visible on GitHub. In upcoming lessons, you will learn how to better secure this password, or you can start researching npm packages now that could help you.

You might also want to make your queries asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a .promise() function on Connections to upgrade an existing non-Promise connection to use Promises. To learn more and make your queries asynchronous, refer to the npm documentation on MySQL2Links to an external site..


As the image illustrates, your schema should contain the following three tables:

-department

id: INT PRIMARY KEY

name: VARCHAR(30) to hold department name



-role

id: INT PRIMARY KEY

title: VARCHAR(30) to hold role title

salary: DECIMAL to hold role salary

department_id: INT to hold reference to department role belongs to


-employee

id: INT PRIMARY KEY

first_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name

last_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name

role_id: INT to hold reference to employee role

manager_id: INT to hold reference to another employee that is the manager of the current employee (null if the employee has no manager)

You might want to use a separate file that contains functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these. You might also want to include a seeds.sql file to pre-populate your database, making the development of individual features much easier.
